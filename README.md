# Checkers
This is a simple game of checkers made for my web dev course. Unfortunately, you would have to pass the mouse around to play it
with someone, but it's still fun to mess around with.

And shhhhhh... don't tell anyone but there's a bug I still haven't fixed. When you go to jump over two checkers in a row,
you could instead move another piece. So you can move two pieces in one turn if you use the bug correctly. For now though,
I'll just call it a feature. If I fix it, then I'll say that I fixed a bug.
